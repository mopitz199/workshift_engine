# Hello everyonw

To generate the documentation, just go the *'docs'* folder and run:

```sh
$ make html
```

This command will generate a *build* folder into the *'docs'* folder. Go inside the *'build'* folder and open the *'index.html'* file. This file will contain all the necessary documentation.

See ya!
